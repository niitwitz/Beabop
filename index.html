	<img src="images/face.png" alt="deer standing in snow" width="300px">
		<p>Bea-bop is a shapeshifting deer. She has pink sparkly antlers and the rest of her body looks like your typical fawn. She typically wears a 16th century ruff around her neck and has clown makeup on.</p>

		<br>

		<p> Bea-bop is very shy and timid in their day to day life. Preferring to keep to themself over making a scene. They typically spend most of their time in their house playing folk music unless they need to run errands. The only time they are loud or take up space is while performing. Otherwise you would find her in her house drinking tea, playing an instrument, or watching old performance tapes.</p>
